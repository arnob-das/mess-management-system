# mess-management-system

Mess Management System is a software application developed using JavaFX that aims to assist 
students and bachelors living in a mess with managing their expenses. The main objective of this 
software is to help these individuals keep track of their house rent, utilities, and meal costs on a 
monthly basis.
Traditionally, this task is often done manually by mess managers using notebooks, but with Mess 
Management System, users can simply enter their data into the software and the total bill for each 
student in the bachelor house will be automatically generated.
This software makes use of various technologies, including JDK 19, IntelliJ, BootstrapFX, 
Firebase for authentication, and MongoDB for database management. These tools work together 
to provide a user-friendly and efficient solution for managing expenses in a mess setting.


Proposed Goals:
Our objective was to design a mess management system that helps the user to access all the
functionalities of the mess without having to visit the mess physically and apply for leave. It enables
the admin to view the inventory and access guest details. This application is free of cost for the
users.

Software Platform:
•IntelliJ and JDK 19
 •JavaFX
 •Scene Builder
 •MongoDB
 •MongoDB Compass

Conclusion:
The purpose of the project was to make life easier for students living in hostels or rented houses.
The software that was developed helps with meal counting, meal market cost, and deposit money.
This is especially important for students who attend private universities in Bangladesh since most
of these universities do not have hostels, and students have to rent bachelor houses and manage all
the expenses manually. The Mess Management System has made this process more efficient by
allowing users to manage all expenses in real time.
The project proposal was successfully implemented with a 95% match, and additional features
were added. The aim now is to commercialize the software. However, the team faced some
challenges during the development process, specifically with sending data between pages and
sending OTPs like WhatsApp. These issues need to be addressed before commercializing the
software.
Overall, the Mess Management System project has the potential to make a significant impact on
the lives of students, and commercializing the software could be a successful venture. The
development team showed great dedication in implementing the majority of the proposed features
and adding additional ones. With some additional work to address the challenges, the Mess
Management System could be a valuable tool for students in Bangladesh and beyond.
